    Domain Names and ICANN

<h3>Domain Names</h3>
<p1>While many scientists and engineers, like Nikola Tesla theorized of systems like the internet we know today, the idea was first conceptualized in the early 1960’s by J.C.R. Licklider, a renowned psychologist at MIT. Licklider believed early on that computers would allow for a more effective way to communicate, therefore creating a massive network of data exchange amongst its users. Due to the confrontational landscape the United States found themselves in with the rise of technology advancement from the USSR, Eisenhower forged an organization known as ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) to aid in the advancement of space exploration and computer science. Then the space exploration received its own dedicated organization – NASA. </p1>

<h3>ICANN</h3>
<p2>Shortly after the computer science objective fell to researchers. Dr. Leonard Kleinrock a researcher at MIT began developing Queueing Theory. Queueing theory focused on two principles to advance the idea of resource sharing. The first principle was Demand Access, which focused on the idea of not obtaining what you need until you need it. The second principle being Distributed Control, which focused on a singular device would not control the entire network but rather every device share in the authority of the network, contributing collectively. This paved the way for the advancement of data transmission, and ultimately setting the stage for the need of a more efficient means of communicating due to the flaws of telephony’s circuit switching method.</p2>

<h4>Uses and More info</h4>
<p>In the late 1960’s the first prototype of the internet was developed. In 1966 Bob Taylor of ARPA was required to use multiple terminals to access different computers. His theory of being able to utilize a single terminal to access multiple computers and transferring files amongst them led to ARPA receiving funding his research from the Department of Defense. Dr. Lawrence Roberts built the first experimental connection between two computers at the Lincoln laboratory, as he was familiar with the queueing theory through his relationship with Dr. Kleinrock. He was hired by ARPA to scale the networking model. Eventually Roberts discovered how to efficiently build this through IMPs (Interface Message Processors), and packet switching became reality, the first edition of the gateway and now today achieved through routers.</p>
