    IP Addresses, Packets and Routing
</h1>
<h3>What's an IP address?</h3>
<p1>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">Wikipedia</a>, an IP address stands for an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address). How does user and sender information get encoded and transmitted across IP Addresses? Good question, Wikipedia has some more suggested answers: </p1>
<ol>
    <li> Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. </li>
    <li>However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998 </li>
    <li>The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), and by five regional Internet registries (RIRs) responsible in their designated territories for assignment to local Internet registries, such as Internet service providers (ISPs), and other end users.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Packets</h1>
<h3>What are data <i>Packets</i>?</h3>
<p> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm">The Seven Key Principles of Data Transmission</a></p>
<p2> As cited in the above mentioned documentation, data packets resolve the issues of "message must be translated from alphabetic text into electronic signals, transmitted over the Internet, then translated back into alphabetic text. How is this accomplished? Through the use of a protocol stack. Every computer needs one to communicate on the Internet and it is usually built into the computer's operating system (i.e. Windows, Unix, etc.). The protocol stack used on the Internet is refered to as the TCP/IP protocol stack because of the two major communication protocols used."</p2>

<h1 align="center">Routing</h1>
<p><i><strong>Understanding Packet Routing Networks</strong></i></p>
<p>As detailed by Steven Li in his medium post on software engineering entitled: <i><a href="https://medium.com/@User3141592/how-does-the-internet-work-edc2e22e7eb8">How does the Internet Work?</a></i>,
 "It is a network that routes packets from a source computer to a destination computer. The Internet is made up of a massive network of specialized computers called routers. Each router’s job is to know how to move packets along from their source to their destination. A packet will have moved through multiple routers during its journey."(Li)</p>
